Graphs :
1. Keep an eye for directed/non-directed graphs.
2. Don't take for granted the edge direction, not necessary if 1 -> 2 , 2 is root.


Misc :
1. Many a time Greedy algorithm works so don't try to always use DP.
2. If main loop is running from 2 -> n then don't forget to take care of cases where input
is < 2
3. Arrays.sort on Objects uses merge sort which has a wost case of O(n*log(n)).
Arrays.sort on primitives uses quicksort which has a worst case of O(n^2) This
happens if you build the array in a certain manner otherwise quicksort on
average is also O(n*log(n)).
